### Course Description

#### Short (Albert) Version

The saying goes, "If all you have is a hammer, then every problem looks like a
nail." What if all you have is a 3D Printer?  In this course, students will be
introduced to, and engage critically with, a range of contemporary machines
inside and around the Interactive Media Lab. Leveraging historical
perspectives, current use-cases, and hands-on making, the course will explore
how machines enhance, or limit, our creative processes. Readings and
discussion will be paired with practical designing, prototyping, and making of
creative computer controlled devices, such as drawing machines, musical
instruments, or Rube Goldberg contraptions. Over the course of
the semester, students will be exposed to a variety of tools, materials, and
fabrication techniques.  By thinking about machines, using machines, and
making machines, the course will offer insight into our creative relationships
with our tools.

Course material will incorporate both theoretical and practical components.
Students will be exposed to critical analysis regarding the historical and
contemporary use of machines in the context of art and theatrical performance.

#### Long (Syllabus) Version

The saying goes, "If all you have is a hammer, then every problem looks like a
nail." What if all you have is a 3D Printer?  In this course, students will be
introduced to, and engage critically with, a range of contemporary machines
inside and around the Interactive Media Lab. Leveraging historical

how machines enhance, or limit, our creative processes. Readings and
discussion will be paired with practical designing, prototyping, and making of
creative computer controlled devices, such as drawing machines, musical
instruments, and a collaborative Rube Goldberg contraption. Over the course of
the semester, students will be exposed to a variety of tools, materials, and
fabrication techniques as well as learn how to use micro-controllers and
software to give their machines unique behaviors and abilities. By thinking
about machines, using machines, and making machines, the course will offer
insight into our creative relationships with our tools.

Course material will incorporate both theoretical and practical components.
Students will be exposed to critical analysis regarding the historical and
contemporary use of machines in the context of art and theatrical performance.
In parallel, students will also learn about electronics, programming,
machines, and mechanical construction techniques. Over the course of the
semester, students will iterate through multiple machine exercises culminating
in a team project consistent with the class theme and physically integrated in
a class enclosure.  The course will finish with a public presentation of the
class project at the Interactive Media End Of Semester Showcase.

You do not need to prove your brilliance, but do prove your intellectual
engagement and curiosity.

\* The Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs) are described in [Appendix 1: Interactive Media Major Program Learning Outcomes.](#appendix-1-interactive-media-major-program-learning-outcomes-plos)

### Teaching and Learning Methodologies

This is a production based course. Students will be learning primarily through
hands-on experience and iterative experimentation. Classes will move quickly
through each topic, first providing a theoretical foundation along with
technical instruction, moving as quickly as possible to where students
implement each topic themselves.

Individual classes may
consist of, but not be limited to, the following:
lecture, discussion, examples, group work, 
demonstrations, hands-on exercises
and
presentations. 

Outside of the class, students will engage in both individual
and group work. Group work will require coordinating with other 
members of the group to schedule group meetings.

Students are required to 
present their projects
at the Interactive Media End of Semester Showcase.


### Graded Activities

#### Participation

- Engaging in class discussions and offering advice, input, feedback, etc
  during class is a major part of your grade. Participating in class is
  helpful for me to get to know you as an individual and keep track of your
  progress. What is equally important is that it provides you and your
  classmates the opportunity to learn from each other through the sharing of
  failures, successes, and insights on the work you are doing.
- Students must be present at the IM end of semester show.

Rubric:
- Level of participation on a scale of 0 to 3,
    then prorated according to the
  [Grade Distribution](#grade-distribution)

| Performance Indicator | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Frequency of participation in class and in meetings | Frequently initiates contributions and offers to respond to questions posed in class; regularly contributes to discussion or asks questions | Occasionally initiates contributions and offers to respond to questions posed in class; occasionally raises questions in meetings | Rarely initiates contributions and offers to respond to questions posed in class; rarely raises questions in meetings | Does not initiate contributions and will only respond to direct questions posed to student; does not raise questions in meetings |
| Quality of comments / questions | Comments always insightful and constructive; asks insightful questions that demonstrate student has actively listened to the presentation and engaged with the material | Comments mostly insightful; asks questions that demonstrate good engagement with the material presented during the presentation | Comments are sometimes constructive; comments too long or not always relevant to discussion; comments have already been stated | Comments are uninformative; heavy reliance on general sentiment (“I don’t like the idea”, “sounds great”) |
| Listening skills | Actively listens during meetings / presentations, including when other students speak; builds on comments of others; never uses laptop inappropriately | Mostly attentive when others present or pose questions; occasionally needs reminder from instructor to focus or comment; was reminded once not to use laptop during presentations | Often inattentive and needs reminder to focus in class; interrupts others or otherwise disrupts others who are speaking; had to be reminded 2-3 in the semester not to use laptop during presentations | Does not listen to others; speaks while others speak; detracts from discussion; had to be reminded more than 4 times in the semester not to use laptop during presentations |

#### Weekly assignment 

- Weekly assignments at the beginning of the semester present hands-on
  opportunities to put into practice the concepts presented in class. Later in
  the semesterweekly assignments consist primarily, but not exclusively, of
  steps in the development and construction of each individual project
- Unless you have built many complex electromechanical projects in the past,
  you are unlikely to have a good sense of how long tasks should take. Weekly
  assignments help keep the project development and construction on track,
  alert me to difficulties, and break up the project into manageable chunks.
- Each week you are expected to report on your progress in your Github
  repository journal. Each journal entry should include a description of the
  assignment and how you addressed it. Include pictures, videos, and code
  snippets, as appropriate. Include the sources of any information you found
  useful such as code, schematics, explanations, etc.  Copying code or
  techniques without attribution is plagiarism.  Few ideas come out of the
  blue, and your readers can learn a lot from the sources from which you
  learned and by which you were were inspired.  The writing is expected to be
  well reasoned, grammatically correct, and written as if it were a paper
  being turned in. 

Rubric:

  Each weekly assignment is worth up to 2 points,
    then prorated according to the
  [Grade Distribution](#grade-distribution)

| Excellent (2 points) | Poor (1 point) | Incomplete (0 points) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| All parts of the assignment have been completed reliably and robustly; journal documentation is complete and well written | Most parts of the assignment have been completed and are mostly reliable and robust; documentation is mostly present and well written | Most parts of the assignment have been not been completed or are unreliable or not robust; journal entry is incomplete or absent |


#### Midterm 

- Working in teams of 2-3
    develop a working prototype of the most difficult mechanical 
    part of your project
- Document this thoroughly in your Github repository in a file called
  `midtermProject.md`. As you are working in teams, it is sufficient for the
  documentation to be in the repository of one of you, but the other person
  must still create a file called `midtermProject.md` and in it provide a link
  to the documentation in the other team member's repository.

Rubric:

The midterm assignment receives a maximum of 5 points,
    then prorated according to the
  [Grade Distribution](#grade-distribution)

| Criteria | Excellent (5 points) | Very Good (4 points) | Good (3 points) | Marginal (2 points) | Poor (1 point) | Incomplete (0 points) | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| Assignment Quality | All exercise criteria are fulfilled and work shows excellent level of effort and attention to detail.  | Assignment is slightly incomplete or is not implemented to an extremely high standard; documentation is almost entirely complete or is complete but the writing quality does not rise to the level of excellent.  | Assignment is moderately complete or is implemented to a moderate standard; documentation is almost entirely complete or is complete but is only of a moderate quality | Assignment is marginally complete or is implemented to a marginal standard; documentation is marginally complete or is complete but is only of a marginal quality | Assignment is barely complete or is implemented to a very low standard; documentation is barely complete or is only of a poor quality | Hardly any required components are present or assignment was not submitted |

#### Panel presentations

Each student will research two cultural, social, historical, contemporary, ethical, technical,
or aesthetic topics in the field of machine art, and develop and defend a thesis
in each one with proper supporting evidence. This can include an individual
artist, an art collective, an art project, or an art movement.

Students will give their presentations in
panels consisting of four students. Each panel will work together to read and
discuss each others' presentations, and each panelist will lead the class in a
short discussion on the presentation of one of the other panelists. Panelists
are responsible for coordinating amongst themselves meeting times to prepare.

Each student is free to select their topics but must communicate their
choices to me for approval by week 3.
A spreadsheet
will be provided for each student to 
select the dates for giving their 
presentations and participating in the panel discussions
on a "first-come, first-served" basis.

Panels will take place during the short meeting of weeks 4-10.

Rubric:

The panel presentations receive a maximum of 10 points,
    then prorated according to the
  [Grade Distribution](#grade-distribution)

| Criteria | Excellent (5 points) | Very Good (4 points) | Good (3 points) | Marginal (2 points | Poor (1 point) | Incomplete (0 points | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |

| Discussion Quality | Discussion is of high quality and shows evidence of excellent understanding of and engagement with the presentation; Questions are thoughtful and insightful; panelist's replies are integrated into further questions | Discussion is of very good quality and shows evidence of very good understanding of and engagement with the presentation; Questions are thoughtful and insightful; panelist's replies are very well integrated into further questions | Discussion is of good quality and shows evidence of good understanding of and engagement with the presentation; Questions are mostly thoughtful and insightful; panelist's replies are well integrated into further questions | Discussion is of marginal quality and shows evidence of marginal understanding of and engagement with the presentation; Questions are marginally thoughtful and insightful; panelist's replies are not well integrated into further questions | Discussion is of poor quality and shows evidence of poor understanding of and engagement with the presentation; Questions are barely thoughtful and offer little to no insight; panelist's replies are barely integrated into further questions | No discussion |

#### Final project 

This class culminates in the construction of a large
semi-permanent electromechanical installation consisting
of five individual group projects based on a common theme.


Rubric:

The final project receives a maximum of 20 points,
    then prorated according to the
  [Grade Distribution](#grade-distribution)

| Criteria | Excellent (5 points) | Very Good (4 points) | Good (3 points) | Marginal (2 points | Poor (1 point) | Incomplete (0 points |

At NYU Abu Dhabi, a commitment to excellence, fairness,
honesty, and respect within and outside the classroom is essential to
maintaining the integrity of our community. By accepting membership in this
community, students, faculty, and staff take responsibility for demonstrating
these values in their own conduct and for recognizing and supporting these
values in others. In turn, these values create a campus climate that
encourages the free exchange of ideas, promotes scholarly excellence through
active and creative thought, and allows community members to achieve and be
recognized for achieving their highest potential.

Students should be aware that engaging in behaviors that violate the standards
of academic integrity will be subject to review and may face the imposition of
penalties in accordance with the procedures set out in the NYUAD policy. 

The full policies and
procedures relating to Academic Integrity may be found on the [NYUAD Student
Portal](https://students.nyuad.nyu.edu/campus-life/student-policies/community-standards-policies/academic-integrity/)

### Other Course Information

#### How to succeed in this course
1. Arrive on time or a few minutes early
1. Attend every lesson unless you are sick
1. If you miss a lesson, ask a classmate to fill you in on what you missed
1. Silence all notifications on your laptop, phone, and watch
1. Bring a notebook to class and take notes during class
1. Ask questions and participate in discussions and critique
1. During in-class hands-on activities, work diligently. Once you have the
   basic thing working, experiment with modifications
1. Start homework and projects early
1. For any assignment or project, do the most difficult part first
1. Document your work as you go along, writing directly in your journal. Take
   photographs and videos as appropriate.
   Draw sketches in your notebook, photograph them, and add to your journal.
1. Pay attention when things go wrong. Try to understand why. Ask questions,
   do research on the internet. The ability to approach debugging with 
   a logical and critical mind is a superpower.
1. Aim to have your weekly assignments done two days before they are due
1. Expect things to take much longer than you think. Be pleasantly surprised
   when they don't. 
   Feel free to tell me that I was wrong
1. Expect unexpected problems and failures. Embrace the opportunity to learn
   something new. 
1. Expect things to not work when you think they should
1. Beware of the word "should", such as "this shouldn't take too long" or
   "this should work". Unless you've built many machine projects in the past, 
   you have
   no basis for making this judgement and you are probably wrong.
1. Put serious effort into solving problems, but at the same time be ready to
   change your design or plan to avoid the issue. Knowing when to abandon a
   problem and instead to develop a workaround is another superpower.
1. Reach out to me early and often. 
    I like it when students ask me questions.
    Don't be afraid of becoming a nuisance to me. 
    That is my responsibility, 
    and in all my years of teaching that has never happened.
