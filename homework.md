## Homework due Monday 29 January 2023

1. If you don't already have one, create a Github account. Instructions are here. 
I encourage you to name your account with your name to make it easier for me to 
know belongs to each account

1. In your Github account, create a repository called "MachineLab"

1. In your MachineLab repository, create a file called "homework_29Jan"

1. In the file "homework_29Jan" propose 3 themes for the class clock

1. In the file "homework_29Jan" propose 5 possible topics to research for this
   course. Topics can include authors, inventors, artists, machines, projects,
   locations, etc. Write a sentence about why you feel this topic belongs, and
   provide at least one link to some further information about it. You do not
   need to commit to researching any one of these topics; you may pick
   something else, and someone else may pick one of yours

Example:

Lewis Mumford: Lewis Mumford was an American historian, sociologist,
philosopher of technology, and literary critic. Particularly noted for his
study of cities and urban architecture, he had a broad career as a writer.  He
made signal contributions to social philosophy, American literary and cultural
history, and the history of technology.

The Lathe: The lathe is a machine tool which holds the workpiece between two
rigid and strong supports called centers or in a chuck. The workpiece is
revolved.  The cutting tool is rigidly held and supported in a tool post which
is fed against the revolving work. The normal cutting operations are performed
with the cutting tool fed either parallel or at right angles to the axis of
the work. Because of the rotation, lathes are generally used for making round
parts

Arthur Ganson: Arthur Ganson is a kinetic sculptor. He makes mechanical art
demonstrations and Rube Goldberg machines with existential themes. His moving
sculptures have been exhibited at a number of science museums and art
galleries. Ganson's work appeals to viewers of all ages, and has been featured
in an animated children's television show. He has invented mass-produced
children's toys, and hosts an annual competition to make Rube Goldberg chain
reaction machines.

Welding: Welding is a technique for joining parts by heating them up so
that they melt together, usually with the addition of filler material. This is
in contrast to brazing or soldering in which the parts do not melt. Welding
usually uses a gas or flux to keep oxygen away which would cause oxidation.
Common welding technologies include MIG, TIG, and stick welding.

Gear Motor: A Gear Motor is the combination of a motor with a set of gears
which reduce the speed of the motor while increasing the available torque.
Torque is the measure of a motor's ability to move something. It is easy to
build a motor which spins fast but has little torque, so motors by themselves
are often not useful. By combining the motor with a set of gears, a useful
range of speeds and torques is achieved
