## Homework due Monday 29 January 2024

1. If you don't already have one, create a Github account. Instructions are 
[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses?tab=readme-ov-file#github-resources). 
I encourage you to name your account with your name to make it easier for me to 
tell who belongs to each account. 

1. In your Github account, create a repository called "MachineLab"

1. In your MachineLab repository, create a file called "homework_29Jan"

1. In the file "homework_29Jan" propose 3 themes for the class clock

1. In the file "homework_29Jan" propose 5 possible topics to research for this
   course. Topics can include authors, inventors, artists, machines, projects,
   locations, etc. Write a sentence about why you feel this topic belongs, and
   provide at least one link to some further information about it. You do not
   need to commit to researching any one of these topics; you may pick
   something else, and someone else may pick one of yours

Example:

Lewis Mumford: Lewis Mumford was an American historian, sociologist,
philosopher of technology, and literary critic. Particularly noted for his
study of cities and urban architecture, he had a broad career as a writer.  He
made signal contributions to social philosophy, American literary and cultural
history, and the history of technology. Of particular relevance to this class,
Mumford criticized the modern trend of technology, which emphasizes constant,
unrestricted expansion, production, and replacement. He contends that these
goals work against technical perfection, durability, social efficiency, and
overall human satisfaction. Modern technology, which he called "megatechnics,"
fails to produce lasting, quality products by using devices such as consumer
credit, installment buying, non-functioning and defective designs, planned
obsolescence, and frequent superficial "fashion" changes.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Mumford

The Lathe: The lathe is a machine tool which holds the workpiece between two
rigid and strong supports called centers or in a chuck. The workpiece is
revolved.  The cutting tool is rigidly held and supported in a tool post which
is fed against the revolving work. The normal cutting operations are performed
with the cutting tool fed either parallel or at right angles to the axis of
the work. Because of the rotation, lathes are generally used for making round
parts. Metal working lathes typically have extremely high precision, allowing
them to be used to make parts for other machines, which is why the lathe is
called a "machine tool".
- https://engineering.myindialist.com/2009/working-principle-of-lathe-machine/

Arthur Ganson: Arthur Ganson is a kinetic sculptor. He makes mechanical art
demonstrations and Rube Goldberg machines with existential themes. His moving
sculptures have been exhibited at a number of science museums and art
galleries. Ganson's work appeals to viewers of all ages, and has been featured
in an animated children's television show. He has invented mass-produced
children's toys, and hosts an annual competition to make Rube Goldberg chain
reaction machines.

Welding: Welding is a technique for joining parts by heating them up so
that they melt together, usually with the addition of filler material. This is
in contrast to brazing or soldering in which the parts do not melt. Welding
usually uses a gas or flux to keep oxygen away which would cause oxidation.
Common welding technologies include MIG, TIG, and stick welding.
- https://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/faqs/what-is-welding

Gear Motor: A Gear Motor is the combination of a motor with a set of gears
which reduce the speed of the motor while increasing the available torque.
Torque is the measure of a motor's ability to move something. It is easy to
build a motor which spins fast but has little torque, so motors by themselves
are often not useful. By combining the motor with a set of gears, a useful
range of speeds and torques is achieved

## Homework due Wednesday 31 January 2024

from now on all homework must be markdown (except code)

## Homework due Monday 5 February 2024

(1)

- Inspired by all the [proposed
  themes](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/MachineLab/blob/master/lectureNotes.md#theme)
  as well as anything else you can think of, chose one or two themes
  that you would be excited to work on. 
- Discuss with other classmates either on Discord or in other ways, and 
  find two or three other people to work with. You may find that you
  all need to modify your ideas in order to find one that you all would be
  excited to work on. You may end up discarding all your original ideas and
  come up with a brand new theme. That's OK.
- As a group, develop the idea more fully. 
- Give rough suggestions for 4 projects on this theme. Assume these will be
  worked on by the other groups.
- Assume that one project will be the one your group is working on, and
  develop it in more detail: 
    - What would it depict? 
    - What materials will you use for each part? 
    - How would you animate anything moving?  
    - Will there be sound? What?
    - Will there be lights? (We have lots of NeoPixels.) 
    - Make a rough sketch, to the best of your ability. 
    - What mechanical components will you need?
    - What electronic components will you need?
    - Draw a block diagram showing very roughly how these components are
      connected. You don't need to show the circuit or specific wires, just in
      general what is connected to what. 
    - What tools or equipment or skills will you need?
- Write this up in your Github repository, in a file named "homework_05Feb.md".
  - Remember to use MarkDown and format it properly. 
  - Include any sketches or pictures (maybe inspiration, a look you're
    going for, or a mood board, etc.). Look in my lecture notes to see how to
    include images.
  - You can divide the report up into parts and each of you in your group can
    do one part. Make sure you address all the requirements above. 
    In each of your parts provide a link to the other parts.  Look in my
    lecture notes to see how to create links.


(2)

You will make two presentations during the course of this class:
- An artist, inventor, designer, historian, or other human figure who
  works (or worked) with or about machines
- A machine, technology, invention, artwork, or device that is somehow about
  machines

Choose your topics for each of these presentations. The presentations will be
due later in the semester, but you need to select the topics now. Email me the
topics before Monday's class. If two of you chose the same topic then the
first one gets it and those that come later will need to select a different
topic.

You can look at each other's homework to get more ideas.

## Homework due Wednesday 7 February 2024

1. I have listed the [teams](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/MachineLab/blob/master/lectureNotes.md#teams) in our lecture notes. 

	1. As I mentioned in class, I expect there to be some changes. In particular
I encourage some of you to move to other teams to balance out the numbers. But
you don't need to do this right away.

	1. With your team, sketch out your initial overall plan for your project. 

	1. Identify the most risky, complicated, or frightening element of your
project. This is what you will work on first. 

	1. Make a rough sketch of how you will build this most frightening element.
Include as many details as you can. After I review this, you will start
building, so you should include whatever information you think you will need
in order to start working. This also helps catch gaps in your concept.

	1. Don't be afraid to ask questions! I may have answers!

	1. Document this in a file named "homework_07Feb.md". As before,
different members of the team can document different parts, and you should all
link to each other's part.

1. On Wednesday you will all be given tool training in the IM lab. Please
   dress appropriately for such work. Closed toed shoes are recommended, no
   loose clothing, and clothes that you don't mind getting a little dirty.

## Homework due Monday 12 February 2024

Start building your most difficult thing. You can start building
on the wooden frames or on a scrap of wood or cardboard.
I think you all know what areas I'm most concerned about and how to get
started; if you're unsure please reach out to me on Discord.

Your assignment this week is to get something moving. I want you to get
experience working with the motors and solving problems. You will need to
figure out:
- How to attach the motor to your base (probably some sort of bracket)
- how to attach whatever you need moving to the motor (probably a hub)
- How to control the motor (speed, direction, how far it goes) to get the
  motion you want

I expect you will discover things that may not work the first time.

As always, document your work in one of your repositories. Name the file
"homework_12Feb.md". Include initial sketches and photographs of whatever you
make. Don't wait for your project to be done! In fact, I don't even care about
the finished piece. I want you to document what doesn't work.
Include pictures of the work in progress and how things failed.
Was the bracket too weak to hold the motor? Did the thing your moving fall of
the hub? Did the motor get stuck? Did it go the wrong way and break something?
Discuss how things didn't work. Include details. List your ideas
for solving the problem, and then describe what you tried and whether that
worked or whether you discovered a different problem.

You will probably need some equipment from me such as:
- Motors
- Power supply
- Gears/pulleys/hubs/axles/bearings
- Motor bracket or metal to make your own bracket

Remember that if you need any tools you will have to ask me, one of the IM
instructors (Ume or Stefania), or one of the lab assistants. I know that this
will be a limitation. Do the best you can. You may want to build everything
using cardboard and hot glue, because you can access cardboard, scissors, and
the hot glue guns without tool training. 

I'm waiting to see whether we can staff the lab on the weekend. I will keep
you updated. I am available Saturday and Sunday afternoons.

Discuss any needs or issues on Discord so that I can help.

## Homework due Wednesday 14 February 2024
1. Wear closed toed shoes for tool training!
1. Arrange to pick up things you need for your next step:
    1. Carousel team: DC motor with tire and a piece of wood. Design bracket.
    1. Swinging boat: What do you need for your next step?
    1. Sky Ride: Get the very slow 10RPM motor from me. Design the pulleys
        to be 3D printed.
    1. Candy store: Get a DC motor and lazy susan from me
    1. Roller Coaster: Get a DC motor and the longer belt from me. Design
       bracket to hold the motor.

## Homework due Monday 19 February 2024

I know that many of you will do this work on the weekend, so I will be
available for a little while on the weekend, but not all day, and not late.

As always, document your work in one of your repositories. Name the file
"homework_19Feb.md". Include initial sketches and photographs of whatever you
make. Don't wait for your project to be done! In fact, I don't even care about
the finished piece. I want you to document what doesn't work.
Include pictures of the work in progress and how things failed.
Was the bracket too weak to hold the motor? Did the thing your moving fall of
the hub? Did the motor get stuck? Did it go the wrong way and break something?
Discuss how things didn't work. Include details. List your ideas
for solving the problem, and then describe what you tried and whether that
worked or whether you discovered a different problem.

Most of you are using 12V DC motors. We have not used them yet in class but
they are simple to use:
1. Connect the motor to Arduino using the motor driver and the 12V power
   supply that we used in class for the stepper motor. To connect the motor
   follow
   [this](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/arduino-dc-motor-control-tutorial-l298n-pwm-h-bridge/)
   tutorial. Scroll down to where it says "Arduino and L298N Motor Driver" and
   shows a picture of only one motor. That is how you should wire up your
   motor and Arduino. You don't need the potentiometer and switch shown on
   the right side of the drawing. 
1. Note that this circuit has an error: they
   left off a ground connection to the Arduino. Look in your notes to see how
   to attach a ground wire between your Arduino and the L298 Motor driver.
1. Use your Arduino to make the motor rotate. You may want to reduce the speed
   as the full speed may be too fast. This is described in the tutorial.

Each of you have different goals for Monday:

**Carousel team**: 
You now have the DC motor with a wheel and tire. I want you to mount this so
that it will turn your carousel. I suggest the following, but it might change
as you discover what works and what doesn't:
1. You will need to make your carousel circular. Ideally find a piece of
   plywood that is already circular, or ask Nelson to help you. This is due on
   Monday, and Nelson doesn't work on the weekend, so you will have to do this
   on Friday. That's tomorrow so you had better hurry up
1. Mount your circular piece of plywood on top of the lazy susan
1. You'll need a bigger base so that you can mount the motor. You can use any
   of the scrap wood you can find in the IM lab, or you can ask me or Nelson
   to get you some from the Scene Shop. 
1. Mount the motor in the bracket and mount the motor to the frame on a hinge
   so that it can swing towards the carousel and apply pressure between the
   tire and the carousel. You will need a hinge. I think there are some in our
   tip out bins behind the white board - let me know if not
1. Press the motor and wheel against the carousel and confirm that it can turn
   it. 

**Swinging Boat team**:
1. Build a frame out of wood to hold your motor and the boat itself. 
1. I can't remember what motor your using in the end. I think the large servo
   motor. You will need to make a bracket to mount it. Make an appointment to
   meet me today, tomorrow, or Saturday so that I can help you make a bracket.
   Do not wait until Sunday.
1. Build a better model of the boat so that you can get a sense of how it will
   act as it is swung. You can still use cardboard.
1. Add a short strand (5-10 pixels) of Neopixels to the boat and run the wires
   to it so that you can see how the wires behave when the boat swings. You
   will have to construct some sort of guide to keep the wires where you want
   them and to let them swing with the boat.
1. Research
   [Neopixels](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/the-magic-of-neopixels)
   and do a quick test to make sure that you understand how to control the
   colors and brightness of the pixels

**Sky Ride team**:
1. I have given you the 10 RPM motor.  You will need to make a bracket to
   mount it. Make an appointment to meet me today, tomorrow, or Saturday so
   that I can help you make a bracket.  Do not wait until Sunday.
1. Design and 3Dprint a pair of pulleys, one to fit on the motor, and one to
   fit on a bearing that will spin on a shaft. I suggest a 5mm shaft. I have
   bearings that have a 5mm internal diameter and a 14mm outside diameter.
   Design something to hold the bearing.
1. What will you use as the cable? Do you want the green urethane belting that
   I showed in class? Arrange to get some from me.
1. Build a better prototoype of your ride so that the motor turns the pulleys
   and the cable
1. Make a prototype of a car and figure out how to attach it to the cable

**Candy Store team**: 
1. You have now a DC motor and lazy susan. Built the rotating tree.
1. Research
   [Neopixels](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/the-magic-of-neopixels)
   and get a short strand (5-10 pixels) of Neopixels.  Do a quick test to make
   sure that you understand how to control the colors and brightness of the
   pixels
1. I feel there is not enough motion in your project. What else can you
   animate? Some animals? Dolls? Make a face where the eyes move from side to
   side? Hands and arms that move? A candy farm where candy grows out of the
   ground? 

**Roller Coaster team**: 
1. I have given you the 10 RPM motor.  You will need to make a bracket to
   mount it. Make an appointment to meet me today, tomorrow, or Saturday so
   that I can help you make a bracket.  Do not wait until Sunday.
1. At the same time work with me to get the longer belt out of last year's
   project.
1. Build a better prototype of your project using wood
1. Answer the question of how you will make the tracks. 
1. Design the cars so that they can ride on the track. Maybe you can use some
   toy cars that you can buy, or you can design your own from scratch. Build
   one and test that it stays on the track.

## Homework due Monday 26 February 2024

Announcements:

1. I don't expect to be in the lab on Saturday but I am still available later in
the afternoon if you have any needs. On Sunday I expect to be in my office in
the afternoon.
1. On Monday we will visit the Machine Shop. Please try to be in class on time
   so that we can all walk over together to the back of C1. If you can't be
   there on time make sure that you can contact one of your classmates to
   coordinate meeting us along the way. The back of C1 is accessed from the
   road that runs behind the campus.

As always, document your work in one of your repositories. 
Include initial sketches and photographs of whatever you
make. Don't wait for your project to be done! In fact, I don't even care about
the finished piece. I want you to document what doesn't work.
Include pictures of the work in progress and how things failed.
Was the bracket too weak to hold the motor? Did the thing your moving fall of
the hub? Did the motor get stuck? Did it go the wrong way and break something?
Discuss how things didn't work. Include details. List your ideas
for solving the problem, and then describe what you tried and whether that
worked or whether you discovered a different problem.

There is a new section I want you to add each week: What will you get done for
next week?

You may either name your homework file "homework_26Feb.md", or, if you prefer
to have everything in one long journal, simply call it "journal.md".
Documentation for a team can be in any of your repositories, but all
other team members must include a link to it. The link should be in a file as
named above. It's OK if this is in different repositories.

I think I described to you on Wednesday pretty clearly what I want to see on
Monday, so I will list it here only briefly:

**Sky Ride team** (Liza, Ronit):
On Monday I want to see the belt moving with at least one car that goes around
the motor pulley. 
If you can't get everything 3D printed you need to come up
with another way to prototype. If you can't demonstrate this then I think you
need to come up with a different ride.

**Candy Store team** (Jackie, Juanma, Aigerim): 
I think you're on track.

**Roller Coaster team** (Swostik, Dania, Sunny): 
On Monday I want to see a train that can climb a hill. 
If you can't get everything 3D printed you need to come up
with another way to prototype. If you can't demonstrate this then I think you
need to come up with a different ride.

**Swinging Boat team** (Fatema, Salama, Noah):
You're mostly on track. I'm a little concerned about the amount of swing and
the size and shape of the space you have. I'd like to see the proportions
worked out so that you know how big the boat is and how far it swings. This
will also tell you what space you have left, and I'd like to see some sketches
for how you intend to fill that empty space. Since you've already demonstrated
your mechanism and have a rough boat prototype, you can do this assignment on
paper (or computer). 

**Carousel team** (Aya, Evelyn, Ehtisham):
Verify that you can reliable power an Arduino, a couple of NeoPixels, and a
servo motor through the slipring while it's rotating, and start working out
the structure for the top part of the carousel and the mechanisms for the
horses.

## Homework due Monday 4 March 2024

1) Keep making progress, keep updating your journal as described above
2) On Monday we will tour the Advanced Manufacturing Workshop located in building A5. Please meet in the lobby of A5. Please be on time.


## Homework due Wednesday 3 April 2024

1. Mount the Arduino holder on the back of your frame. If you don't want to
   drill holes in the back wall you can mount the Arduino holder to one of the
   ribs in the back for now.
1. Stick your solderless breadboard to the back wall as well
1. Start wiring up your motors using the solderless breadboard. Use
   **stranded** wires everywhere. You can solder on a short piece of **solid**
   wire to the end that needs to go into the solderless breadboard
1. Leave all the wires longer than necessary so that you can move things
   around as necessary
1. Label your power connectors very clearly so we don't plug the wrong voltage
   in and damage anything

##### todays-assignment
## Homework due Wednesday 24 April 2024
- Add your Music Maker Shield and a loudspeaker to your project. The
  loudspeaker can be mounted in a temporary position such as to one of the
  ribs in the back of your frame.
- All your power feeds should be clearly labeled, one each for 12V and/or 5V (NeoPixels and servo
  motors). Is anyone using any other voltages? 
- Each power feed should end in a **clearly labelled** coax connector:   
![](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/blob/master/media/coaxConnector.png)
- There should be at most one of
  each, in other words, if you have multiple servos, the 5V line should all be
  connected together to one coax plug.
- Your breadboard should have a button and an LED. Your activity should start
  when the button is pressed. When your activity stops the LED should turn on.
  You can use [my
  example](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/MachineLab/blob/master/src/musicShieldAndMotor/musicShieldAndMotor.ino)
  as an example of the overall concept, and you may need my multitasking
  examples for [many servos without
  delay](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/blob/master/src/arduinoSketches/noDelay/manyServosNoDelay/manyServosNoDelay.ino)
  or [fading NeoPixels without
  delay](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/blob/master/src/arduinoSketches/noDelay/fadeNeoWithoutDelay/fadeNeoWithoutDelay.ino)
- Your project does not need to be completed: you may still be working on the
  sounds, actions, decorations. *At the bare minimum you should have one action
  and one sound that responds to the button, runs for  awhile, and then turns
  on the LED.*
