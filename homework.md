## Homework due Thursday 22 January 2026

### Reading homework
If you missed the first class:
- Read the course syllabus
- Read today's lecture notes

Everyone:
Read or review as necessary:
- [Sparkfun breadboard tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all)
- [Microcontrollers, the basics](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/microcontrollers-the-basics/)
- [Digital Input &
  Output](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/digital-input-output/)
- [Analog output](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/analog-output/)
- [Analog Input](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/analog-input/)
- Read or watch a tutorial of your own choosing on how to use a servo motor with Arduino

Everyone:
Read:
- Read at least one of of the [Blink Without Delay
  Resources](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses?tab=readme-ov-file#blink-without-delay-resources)
- Read the [Adafruit Multitasking
  Tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-tasking-the-arduino-part-1?view=all)

### Fabrication homework

You will construct a simple crane structure, in which the horizontal arm 
can be rotated from side to side using a servo motor.

Since the IM lab is not staffed yet, you may not be able to access the lab,
and thus this part of the homework is not mandatory. However I would like you
to try to do it, if possible, so as to get some experience with how structures
and motors behave.

To access the required tools and materials, some options include:
1. If you are a capstone student, you should have access to the lab.
1. If you are not a capstone student, coordinate with a capstone student
   (using Discord!) to work on this assignment at the same time. 
1. Use your own tools and materials, if you have them
1. Coordinate with me (using Discord!) to get access to the lab or to use my
   tools and work near my office (C3-156)

Details:
- Using cardboard and hot glue, and whatever else you wish, construct a simple
  crane structure consisting of a vertical column and a horizontal arm. Do not
  attach the arm to the column yet.
- Attach a servo motor to the column so that it can rotate the arm
- Attach the arm to the servo motor so that the servo motor can rotate the arm
- Use the Arduino servo example *sweep* to sweep your crane's arm from side to
  side. You may need to modify the example e.g. to make it sweep slower, or to
  reduce the extent of the sweep, to avoid damaging your crane.

### Other homework

1. If you don't already have one, create a Github account. Instructions are 
[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses?tab=readme-ov-file#github-resources). 
I encourage you to name your account with your name to make it easier for me to 
tell who belongs to each account. 
1. In your Github account, create a repository called "MachineLab"
1. In your MachineLab repository, create a file called "journal"
1. You should have received an invitation to join the IM Discord server. If
   you have not received it, or if it doesn't work, let me know immediately
   via email. Do not wait until Thursday. If you tell me on Thursday in class
   that you were not able to join Discord that will count as not having
   completed the assignment.
1. In the class Discord channel, suggest at least one them for the class
   project
