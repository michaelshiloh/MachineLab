## Homework due Monday 29 January 2024

1. If you don't already have one, create a Github account. Instructions are 
[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses?tab=readme-ov-file#github-resources). 
I encourage you to name your account with your name to make it easier for me to 
tell who belongs to each account. 

1. In your Github account, create a repository called "MachineLab"

1. In your MachineLab repository, create a file called "homework_29Jan"

1. In the file "homework_29Jan" propose 3 themes for the class clock

1. In the file "homework_29Jan" propose 5 possible topics to research for this
   course. Topics can include authors, inventors, artists, machines, projects,
   locations, etc. Write a sentence about why you feel this topic belongs, and
   provide at least one link to some further information about it. You do not
   need to commit to researching any one of these topics; you may pick
   something else, and someone else may pick one of yours

Example:

Lewis Mumford: Lewis Mumford was an American historian, sociologist,
philosopher of technology, and literary critic. Particularly noted for his
study of cities and urban architecture, he had a broad career as a writer.  He
made signal contributions to social philosophy, American literary and cultural
history, and the history of technology. Of particular relevance to this class,
Mumford criticized the modern trend of technology, which emphasizes constant,
unrestricted expansion, production, and replacement. He contends that these
goals work against technical perfection, durability, social efficiency, and
overall human satisfaction. Modern technology, which he called "megatechnics,"
fails to produce lasting, quality products by using devices such as consumer
credit, installment buying, non-functioning and defective designs, planned
obsolescence, and frequent superficial "fashion" changes.

The Lathe: The lathe is a machine tool which holds the workpiece between two
rigid and strong supports called centers or in a chuck. The workpiece is
revolved.  The cutting tool is rigidly held and supported in a tool post which
is fed against the revolving work. The normal cutting operations are performed
with the cutting tool fed either parallel or at right angles to the axis of
the work. Because of the rotation, lathes are generally used for making round
parts. Metal working lathes typically have extremely high precision, allowing
them to be used to make parts for other machines, which is why the lathe is
called a "machine tool".

Arthur Ganson: Arthur Ganson is a kinetic sculptor. He makes mechanical art
demonstrations and Rube Goldberg machines with existential themes. His moving
sculptures have been exhibited at a number of science museums and art
galleries. Ganson's work appeals to viewers of all ages, and has been featured
in an animated children's television show. He has invented mass-produced
children's toys, and hosts an annual competition to make Rube Goldberg chain
reaction machines.

Welding: Welding is a technique for joining parts by heating them up so
that they melt together, usually with the addition of filler material. This is
in contrast to brazing or soldering in which the parts do not melt. Welding
usually uses a gas or flux to keep oxygen away which would cause oxidation.
Common welding technologies include MIG, TIG, and stick welding.
- https://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/faqs/what-is-welding

Gear Motor: A Gear Motor is the combination of a motor with a set of gears
which reduce the speed of the motor while increasing the available torque.
Torque is the measure of a motor's ability to move something. It is easy to
build a motor which spins fast but has little torque, so motors by themselves
are often not useful. By combining the motor with a set of gears, a useful
range of speeds and torques is achieved

## Homework due Wednesday 31 January 2024

from now on all homework must be markdown (except code)

## Homework due Monday 5 February 2024

(1)

- Inspired by all the [proposed
  themes](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/MachineLab/blob/master/lectureNotes.md#theme)
  as well as anything else you can think of, chose one or two themes
  that you would be excited to work on. 
- Discuss with other classmates either on Discord or in other ways, and 
  find two or three other people to work with. You may find that you
  all need to modify your ideas in order to find one that you all would be
  excited to work on. You may end up discarding all your original ideas and
  come up with a brand new theme. That's OK.
- As a group, develop the idea more fully. 
- Give rough suggestions for 4 projects on this theme. Assume these will be
  worked on by the other groups.
- Assume that one project will be the one your group is working on, and
  develop it in more detail: 
    - What would it depict? 
    - What materials will you use for each part? 
    - How would you animate anything moving?  
    - Will there be sound? What?
    - Will there be lights? (We have lots of NeoPixels.) 
    - Make a rough sketch, to the best of your ability. 
    - What mechanical components will you need?
    - What electronic components will you need?
    - Draw a block diagram showing very roughly how these components are
      connected. You don't need to show the circuit or specific wires, just in
      general what is connected to what. 
    - What tools or equipment or skills will you need?
- Write this up in your Github repository, in a file named "homework_05Feb.md".
  - Remember to use MarkDown and format it properly. 
  - Include any sketches or pictures (maybe inspiration, a look you're
    going for, or a mood board, etc.). Look in my lecture notes to see how to
    include images.
  - You can divide the report up into parts and each of you in your group can
    do one part. Make sure you address all the requirements above. 
    In each of your parts provide a link to the other parts.  Look in my
    lecture notes to see how to create links.


(2)

You will make two presentations during the course of this class:
- An artist, inventor, designer, historian, or other human figure who
  works (or worked) with or about machines
- A machine, technology, invention, artwork, or device that is somehow about
  machines

Choose your topics for each of these presentations. The presentations will be
due later in the semester, but you need to select the topics now. Email me the
topics before Monday's class. If two of you chose the same topic then the
first one gets it and those that come later will need to select a different
topic.

You can look at each other's homework to get more ideas.

## Homework due Wednesday 7 February 2024

1. I have listed the [teams](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/MachineLab/blob/master/lectureNotes.md#teams) in our lecture notes. 

	1. As I mentioned in class, I expect there to be some changes. In particular
I encourage some of you to move to other teams to balance out the numbers. But
you don't need to do this right away.

	1. With your team, sketch out your initial overall plan for your project. 

	1. Identify the most risky, complicated, or frightening element of your
project. This is what you will work on first. 

	1. Make a rough sketch of how you will build this most frightening element.
Include as many details as you can. After I review this, you will start
building, so you should include whatever information you think you will need
in order to start working. This also helps catch gaps in your concept.

	1. Don't be afraid to ask questions! I may have answers!

	1. Document this in a file named "homework_07Feb.md". As before,
different members of the team can document different parts, and you should all
link to each other's part.

1. On Wednesday you will all be given tool training in the IM lab. Please
   dress appropriately for such work. Closed toed shoes are recommended, no
   loose clothing, and clothes that you don't mind getting a little dirty.

##### todays-assignment
## Homework due Monday 12 February 2024

Start building your most difficult thing. In some cases you can start building
on the wooden frames; in other cases you will be prototyping in some other
way. I think you all know what areas I'm most concerned about and how to get
started; if you're unsure please reach out to me.

Your assignment this week is to get something moving. I want you to get
experience working with the motors and solving problems. You will need to
figure out:
- How to attach the motor to your base (probably some sort of bracket)
- how to attach whatever you need moving to the motor (probably a hub)
- How to control the motor (speed, direction, how far it goes) to get the
  motion you want

I expect you will discover things that may not work the first time.

As always, document your work in one of your repositories. Name the file
"homework_12Feb.md". Include initial sketches and photographs of whatever you
make. Don't wait for your project to be done! In fact, I don't even care about
the finished piece. I want you to document what doesn't work.
Include pictures of the work in progress and how things failed.
Discuss how things didn't work. Include details. List your ideas
for solving the problem, and then describe what you tried and whether that
worked or whether you discovered a different problem.

You will probably need some equipment from me such as:
- Motors
- Power supply
- Gears/pulleys/hubs/axles/bearings
- Motor bracket or metal to make your own bracket

Remember that if you need any tools you will have to ask me, one of the IM
instructors (Ume or Stefania), or one of the lab assistants. I know that this
will be a limitation. Do the best you can. You may want to build everything
using cardboard and hot glue, because you can access cardboard, scissors, and
the hot glue guns without tool training. 

Discuss any needs or issues on Discord so that I can help.
