An example of a hypothetical final project

Inspiration:
- [Welcome to Duloc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X81AoBcVnaA)


Description:
15 minutes: only trumpets
30 minutes: one panel (or half a panel) opens, only alternating rising and
falling figures
full hour: both panels, figures in the middle going back and forth
bonus, if I can figure out how: the guy who reads the rules

Also, I like this but I'm not sure how it fits in:
