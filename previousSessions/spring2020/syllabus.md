### Course Description
The saying goes, "If all you have is a hammer, then every problem looks like a
nail." What if all you have is a 3D Printer?  In this course, students will be
introduced to, and engage critically with, a range of contemporary machines
inside and around the Interactive Media Lab. Leveraging historical
perspectives, current use-cases, and hands-on making, the course will explore
how machines enhance, or limit, our creative processes. Readings and
discussion will be paired with practical designing, prototyping, and making of
creative computer controlled devices, such as drawing machines, musical
instruments, and a collaborative Rube Goldberg contraption. Over the course of
the semester, students will be exposed to a variety of tools, materials, and
fabrication techniques as well as learn how to use micro-controllers and
software to give their machines unique behaviors and abilities. By thinking
about machines, using machines, and making machines, the course will offer
insight into our creative relationships with our tools.

Over the course of the semester, student will produce four projects:  
* Automata (hand crank and motorized)  
* Computer controlled drawing machine  
* Computer controlled musical instrument  
* Computer controlled Rube Goldberg chain reaction machine (class project)  

Students are expected to exhibit their project work twice, once for the midterm and once as part of the Interactive Media End of Semester show. Participation in both of these events is mandatory.

* 15% Automata (hand crank and motorized)
* 20% Midterm Project: Computer controlled drawing machine
* 15% Computer controlled musical instrument
* 20% Final Project: Computer controlled Rube Goldberg chain reaction machine

#### Attendance
Attendance and arrival on time to all class sessions is required and expected. Two unexcused absences lower your overall final grade by a letter. Each subsequent unexcused absence will lower another letter grade. Two late arrivals will count as one  absence. Arriving more than 20 minutes late will also count as an absence.

If you will be missing a class due to illness or unavoidable personal circumstances, you must notify your professor in advance via email or submit a doctor's note for the absence to be excused.

#### Participation
* Showing up on time, engaging in the class discussion, asking questions and offering answers and in general participating in lessons and discussions during class is an important part of your grade. Participation in class is important to deepen your understanding and is helpful for me to get to know you as an individual and keep track of your progress, and, it provides you and your classmates the opportunity to share successes, failures, and insights into the work you are doing.
* Turn in all assignments on time. For each day an assignment is late, it will result in a lower final grade (e.g. B+ to B).
* You are expected to show work in class. This includes your Github repository, your attempts, and your results whether working or not. You will share what worked and what didn't. Basically, don’t be afraid to volunteer to show what you did do or failed to do. Explaining your work to other people is a great way to better understand the material and answer questions for yourself. Showing work that did not function as expected is not a sign of failure, it is an opportunity to learn.
* Ask questions. If you do not ask questions, I can only assume that you are not prepared for the lesson.

#### Participation Grading Rubric (10%):
- A - Almost always prepared for class including: seated and settled, with notebook and assignment ready, at the beginning of each lesson, ready to engage in class discussion. Has questions or observations prepared, and ready to answer questions from instructor. If encountered difficulty with assignment, can clearly describe the unexpected behavior and what paths were taken to try to resolve them. Asks questions in class. Almost always engages in discussion with instructor and other students. Frequently offers assistance to other students.
- B - Occasionally prepared in most of the ways indicated above.
- C - Infrequently prepared in most of the ways indicated above.
- D - Rarely or never prepared in most of the ways indicated above.

#### Projects 
* Automata (hand crank and motorized)
* Computer controlled drawing machine
* Computer controlled musical instrument
* Computer controlled Rube Goldberg chain reaction machine (class project)

#### Project Grading Rubric (per project)

### Academic Integrity
As set forth in NYU Abu Dhabi's Academic Integrity Policy, the relationship
between students and faculty at NYU Abu Dhabi is defined by a shared
commitment to academic excellence and is grounded in an expectation of
fairness, honesty, and respect, which are essential to maintaining the
integrity of the community. Every student who enrolls and everyone who accepts
an appointment as a member of the faculty or staff at NYU Abu Dhabi agrees to
abide by the expectation of academic honesty.  The full policies and
procedures relating to Academic Integrity may be found on the [NYUAD Student
Portal](https://students.nyuad.nyu.edu/campus-life/student-policies/community-standards-policies/academic-integrity/)

### Teaching Methodology
This is a production-based course that involves programming, electronics, and
mechanisms work both inside and outside of the classroom.  Examples will
presented and discussed throughout, and students will be required to write
code, build circuits, build mechanisms, ask questions, and engage in both
creative and technical discussion. The course embraces a process-oriented
philosophy believing that programming, electronics, and mechatronics
development are best learned by doing.
