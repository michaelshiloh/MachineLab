# Weekly schedule of homework

#### Assignment due Monday 30 January
- If you haven't already done so, join Discord
- If you don't already have one, create a Github account 
	- If you are new to Github read
		[this](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#github-resources)
	- In that account, create a repository called "machineLab"
	- Post a link to your github repository (**not your account!**) in Discord
- Read
	- Read 
   [How to Design and Make Automata](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/blob/master/doc/howToDesignAndMakeAutomata_RobertAdams.pdf)
   or
   [How To Design and Make Simple Automata](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/blob/master/doc/howToDesignAndMakeSimpleAutomata_RobertAdams.pdf)
   (I think they are two versions of the same book. If you prefer video
   tutorials there are many online, Google for something like "linkages
   tutorials" (If you find any good ones let me know.)
	- Download and install the [Arduino
   IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) (not the web editor)
	- If you are new to Arduino read the following:
		- Arduino basics: Intro through Lesson 3 of Adafruit's Arduino
     [tutorial](http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/index.html)
		- The first four tutorials from
     [here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#basic-arduino-resources-from-arduino)
	- Read [Motors and Selecting the Right
   One](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/motors-and-selecting-the-right-one)
	- Learn How to use the L298 Motor Driver using either
		[this](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/arduino-dc-motor-control-tutorial-l298n-pwm-h-bridge/), [this](https://www.etechnophiles.com/l298n-motor-driver-pin-diagram/), [this](http://www.handsontec.com/dataspecs/L298N%20Motor%20Driver.pdf), or find your own by searching using words like "l298 arduino Tutorial". If you find one you like, post it to our Discord channel.
	- Watch Tim Hunkin [Prototypes](https://www.timhunkin.com/a258_Prototypes.htm)
- Browse the [mechatronic
	resources](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#mechatronic-resources)
	paying particular attention to artists, projects, devices, installations,
	machines, etc. The whole page is full of interesting resources.
- Do your own search for something related this class and post your most
	interesting find(s) on Discord

#### Assignment due Monday 6 February

#### Assignment due Monday 13 February

- **Closed toed shoes and no loose garments next week!** for wood shop training

#### Assignment due Wednesday 15 February
- Prepare a presentation on a mechanical machine:
	- Machine must have moving parts
	- Machine can be purely mechanical or electro-mechanical
	- Examples include lathe, mill, printing press, loom, engine, clock,
		sewing machine, [farm
		machinery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge8CBC3vVgs), automatic milking
		machine, VHS video tape recorders, bicycle derailleur, etc.
	- Research the mechanical mechanism of the machine. How does it do what it's
		supposed to do?
	- What is your favorite part of this machine? Why?
	- Identify 3-5 [simple
		machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_machine) in the machine
	- Pay particular attention to interesting, unusual, or inspiring features
		which you might incorporate into your final project
	- Create a new folder on Github called "machinePresentation". Create a
		README.md which then links to your presentation, whether it's also
		uploaded to your repo or elsewhere online.

#### Assignment due Monday 20 February
- Lesson from those who researched how to use the sensors
	- Hall Effect sensor
	- Inductive Proximity sensor
- Inspired by the presentations of machines along with any other sources,
	sketch a very rough first draft of an imaginary mechanism for the clock.
	This is a very early idea and is expected to change, so don't worry about
	being committed to it. This is a thought exercise: How would you imagine
	your mechanism, and how would you make it move.
	Features it must have:
	- Three different levels of activity for the quarter, half, and full hour
	- Consider how you will achieve the motions you need
	- Consider the types of motors and sensors you might need
	- Consider any audio and visuals (LEDs) effects which will enhance the piece
	- Create a new folder on Github called "20February". In that folder create a
		README.md with a description of your very rough first draft along with
		your sketch, pictures, and any other relevant sources of inspiration or
		information

#### Assignment due Wednesday 22 February
- Think about a theme or story we will tell with our clock
- Should our clock be interactive i.e. should we allow any interaction with
	users?

#### Assignment due Monday 27 February
- Choose one of the following topics for a paper of approximately 3 pages,
	excluding pictures. You will also make a short (less than 5 minutes)
	presentation on the topic.  The paper and presentation will be due at a
	later date. Post, on Discord, the subject you have chosen. Each of you must
	choose a different subject: 
	- A specific artist or art collective working with machines 
	- The history of one of the following machines, including what it does and
		how it works:
		- Lathe
		- Mill
		- Wind up clock
		- You may propose other machines which I may accept

- Prepare for Monday's lecture on using Fusion 360 to design parts for laser
	cutting and 3D printing
	- Make an [Autodesk educational
	account](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&filters=individual).
	You will need to submit a picture of you university ID to verify educational
	eligibility.
	- Download and install Fusion 360
	- Watch the following videos in order. This will provide a pretty basic
		understanding of all the processes that will be discussed and should also
		generate questions:
		- [Introduction to Fusion 360](https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/courses/AP-GET-STARTED-OVERVIEW)
		- [User interface overview](https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/courses/AP-USER-INTERFACE-OVERVIEW)
		- [Set preferences](https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/courses/AP-SET-PREFERENCES)
		- [Adjust display settings](https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/courses/AP-ADJUST-DISPLAY-SETTINGS)
		- [Sketch fundamentals](https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/courses/AP-SKETCH-FUNDAMENTALS)
		- [Create and modify sketch geometry](https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/courses/AP-SKETCH-CREATE-MODIFY)
		- [Extrude solid bodies](https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/courses/AP-SOLID-EXTRUDE)
		- [Create component](https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/courses/AP-CREATE-COMPONENT)
		- [Assemblies and joints](https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/courses/AP-ASSEMBLIES-AND-JOINTS)
		- [Assembly motion](https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/courses/AP-ASSEMBLY-MOTION)

#### Assignment due Monday 6 March 
- Come to class on time as we will be leaving for a tour of the Advanced
	Manufacturing Workshop. If you think you might be late have the contact
	number of someone in class so that you can find us.

#### Assignment due Wednesday 8 March 
- Class will meet in front of the ERB (C1) for a tour of the ERB machine shop.
	If you think you might be late have the contact number of someone in class
	so that you can find us.
- Design your portion of the clock. Describe it in some detail. Include
	pictures and links to inspiration.  This is an early idea and is expected to
	change, so don't worry about being committed to it.  Features it must have:
	- In our chosen theme: The UAE
	- Sketch out how you will achieve the motions you need
	- Identify the types of motors and sensors you might need
	- Identify the most difficult mechanism and sketch that out in detail. This
		is the mechanism that you will build first.
	- Describe roughly any audio and visuals (LEDs) effects which will enhance
		your piece
	- Create a new folder on Github called "8March". In that folder create a
		README.md with a description of your very rough first draft along with
		your sketch, pictures, and any other relevant sources of inspiration or
		information

#### Assignments due Monday 27 March 
- Build a prototype of the mechanism you have identified as the most
	difficult. You may use any materials you wish.
- Your paper and presentation on the artist or machine that you have chosen

#### Assignments due Wednesday 29 March 
- Decide who you would like to work with and come up with an initial idea and
	rough sketch of what you'd like to make. This can be based on a previous
	idea or a new idea.

#### Assignments due Monday April 3
- Work with your team mates and decide how you're going to start building your
	structure. One of you should create a new folder ("finalProject" and in it a
	"README.md" in which you will document your progress) in your Github
	repository. Document what you plan to do on Monday. You have many choices:
	- Cardboard prototype 
	- Wood prototype (much stronger, and it gives you a feel for how it will
		work in more solid, less forgiving material)
	- Skip the prototype and start on the final project, whether in wood, metal,
		or plastic
	- Something else 

#### Assignments due Wednesday April 5 
- We will start giving presentations next Wednesday, April 5.  The schedule
	for presentations is [here](studentPapers.md). We will do three presentations
	each Wednesday.
- Photograph and dismantle your cam and crank slider mechanism
- In each team one of you creates a new repository in your Github account for
	the group project, and add your team mates as collaborators. In that
	repository store all your notes and files, and later code, and
	additionally create a journal (journal.md) in which you record your
	progress. In the journal document what you've done so far and what you
	intend to do next. Be prepared to share your progress at each class meeting.

#### Assignments due Wednesday April 12 
- Make a schedule for your project
	- List the necessary tasks
	- Create a schedule so that all these tasks 
		will be finished by May 3 
		(this allows a week for integration)
- Document in your team project journal:
	- What you did since your last work session
	- Did your design change as a result of your work? If so, How?
	- What you plan to do next, and by when

##### todays-assignment
#### Assignments due Monday April 17
