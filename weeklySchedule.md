### Week 1 January 25

#### Introduction

##### todays-assignment
#### Assignment due Monday 30 January
- If you don't already have one, create a Github account 
	- In that account, create a repository called "machineLab"
- **Closed toed shoes and no loose garments next week!** for wood shop
	training
- Read
	- Read 
   [How to Design and Make Automata](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/blob/master/doc/howToDesignAndMakeAutomata_RobertAdams.pdf)
   or
   [How To Design and Make Simple Automata](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/blob/master/doc/howToDesignAndMakeSimpleAutomata_RobertAdams.pdf)
   (I think they are two versions of the same book. If you prefer video
   tutorials there are many online, Google for something like "linkages
   tutorials" (If you find any good ones let me know.)
	- Download and install the [Arduino
   IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) (not the web editor)
	- If you are new to Arduino read the following:
		- Arduino basics: Intro through Lesson 3 of Adafruit's Arduino
     [tutorial](http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/index.html)
		- The first four tutorials from
     [here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#basic-arduino-resources-from-arduino)
	- Read [Motors and Selecting the Right
   One](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/motors-and-selecting-the-right-one)
	- Read [How to use the L298 Motor Driver](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/ryanchan/how-to-use-the-l298n-motor-driver-b124c5)
	- Watch Tim Hunkin [Prototypes](https://www.timhunkin.com/a258_Prototypes.htm)
- Browse the [https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#mechatronic-resources] paying particular attention to artists, projects,
	devices, installations, machines, etc.
	- choose topic for a paper and presentation that you will make later in the
		semester

### Week 2 January 30, February 1

#### Topics: Cardboard, mechanisms, basic motors, wood shop training

#### Activity:
- build cardboard automata

Mechanics
- linkages
- pulleys
- bearings
- bracing
- alignment
- hardware
	- nuts and bolts
	- shaft couplers
	- cutting steel

#### Assignment due Monday 6 February

- Build a hand-crank mechanism of some sort
	- Document
- Connect a motor to your mechanism
	- Document failure modes
	- Repair
	- It must run for 60 seconds without breaking
	- Document

### Week 3 February 6, 8

#### Topics: Arduino, motors, motor shields, position sensing, power supplies

- Arduino
- Motors
	- "DC" motor
	- Servo motor
	- Stepper motor
	- Motor shield(s)
	- External power supply for motor
-	Position sensors
	- Inductive proximity sensor
	- Mechanical limit switch

#### Assignment due Monday 13 February

- Build a new motorized mechanism of some sort 
	- Your mechanism must use a position sensor of some sort to control some
		aspect of its behavior, e.g. when it reaches a certain position it should
		reverse and return to its "home" position
		- Document
	- It must run for 10 cycles without breaking
		- Document failure modes; repair; document success

### Week 4 February 13, 15

#### Topics: time, sound, noise, Neopixels

- Real Time Clocks
- Relays
- MP3 Music Maker Shield

Electricity
- power
	- power supplies
	- distributing power in parallel
- common wires (5V, GND) to sensors
- noise 
	- what is it (RF coupling, load induced fluctuations)
		- perhaps demonstrate with a radio?
	- why it needs to be kept separate from signals
	- how

### Week 5 February 20, 22

#### Topics: Digital fabrication, electrical assembly considerations

Electrical assembly
- leave room for wires
- where to put power supplies
- using DIN rail and connectors
- planning the layout
- attention to detail

Digital fabrication
- 3d printer
- Laser cutter
- Fusion360 or other

#### Assignment due Monday 27 February

Working in teams of two, design and prototype a mechanism for the clock. It
should have three different modes:
- Minimal level of activity on the quarter hour
- Medium level of activity on the half hour
- Full activity on the hour

One week is short for this; I expect a rough prototype that might need
occasional human hand intervention

Your design should include sound but that does not need to be implemented yet

### Week 6 February 27, 29

#### Activity: Demonstrate and critique rough prototype

#### Assignment due March 6

Refine the rough prototype 
- Incorporate critique and feedback
- Make it operate reliably

### Week 7 March 6, 8

#### Assignment due March 27

Implement the rough prototype in the final form

### Spring break March 10 - 22

### Week 8 March 27, 29

#### Activity: Demonstrate and critique progress

#### Assignment due 3 April
- Incorporate critique and feedback
- Fix problems
- Test repeatedly
- Repair
- Document

### Week 9 April 3, 5
### Week 10 April 10, 12
### Week 11 April 17, 19
### Week 12 April 24, 26

#### Activity: Start assembling group projects into final class installation

#### Assignment 
- Test; repair, document, repeat

### Week 13 May 1, 3

#### Activity: Start assembling group projects into final class installation

#### Assignment 
- Test; repair, document, repeat

### Week 13 May 8, 10
