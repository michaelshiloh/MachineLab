### Class rules

This class is fast-paced, difficult, and time consuming. You will have to
learn many skills that are new to you, and you will spend many, many hours
working on your assignments.  You are all top students, otherwise you wouldn't
be at NYUAD. You have gotten here because of your excellent academic skills.
You are used to estimating how long an assignment or project will take based
on your past experiences.  Physical computing involves skills which are
probably new to most of you: mechanics and physical construction.  When the
assignments require skill with which you have little experience, your
time estimates can be very, **very**, *very* wrong.  

I can almost guarantee that you will spend much more time on this class than
you think. Don't take this class if you aren't prepared to work hard and
invest the necessary amount of time.

On the other hand, I am here for you. I want to see you succeed. I like seeing
your projects succeed. You will find me very accessible and helpful. I am
online at all hours and can often solve problem via Discord. I'm also very
available in person and spend much time outside of class in the IM lab or in
my office. You can approach me at any time, but *you* must take the initiative
and reach out to me, and you must not wait until the last minute. You must try
seriously to solve your problems, and if you can't solve them, you must reach
out to me while there is still time for me to help you.

In return I have expectations of you: I expect you to come to class on time
and to be fully present. I expect you to be fully engaged in the course, and to
fully participate in and contribute to class discussion. I expect you to work
hard, very hard, to try to solve problems on your own, and to ask me for help
when you run into trouble. 

I am deeply committed to teaching. I expect you to be fully engaged in this
class. If you are not interested in this material and are taking this class
strictly to fulfill a requirement, I urge you to drop this class and allow
someone who is interested take your place.

I do not tolerate the use of cellphones, earphones, watches, or laptops in
class for anything other than what we're actively working on.  If you need any
exceptions, talk to me.  

I strongly recommend that you take notes on paper.  In particular, when I help
you, I like being able to make notes on paper, so I require that each of you
will have a notebook on hand when you ask for my help.

I understand that there is more going on in your lives than this class.  If
there is stuff going on that is making it difficult to get your work done,
contact me and we'll work something out.  Email is appropriate for these
discussions.

One last thing: I don't want to get sick.  If you're feeling sick, please stay
at home.

#### Logistics

Each of you will write a paper and make a presentation related broadly to the
topic of this class.

This course requires training on different tools. Training is offered only at
certain times, and the training staff does not have the resources to offer
training at other times. You must attend the training sessions unless there
is some truly exceptional reason not to do so. 

You may require separate training for your particular project (e.g. sewing or
welding). You will be responsible for reaching out to the relevant shop to
arrange such training.

You are encouraged to use Discord to ask all questions related to class,
whether technical, logistic, or otherwise. Reserve email for personal matters.

#### Cleaning up

We will be building things. We will use lots of tools and materials. It is
your responsibility to clean up after yourselves, to return tools and
materials to their places, and to put trash and recycling in the appropriate
bins.

Some of the tools and materials are for the exclusive use of our class; others
are generic tools and materials used by other classes. You must return things
to their proper place.

In summary:

- *Always* clean up after yourselves, and always clean up a little more than
	whatever you left. Leave the space cleaner than you found it. Failure to do
	so will result in a lower grade.
- Return tools and unused materials to their proper places
- Discard trash and recycling in the proper bins
- Keep our tools and materials in our space
- If you see anyone outside of our class using our tools, materials, or space,
	please get their names and inform me.

### Homework

All homework will be given in the [Homework](homework.md) file. It is your
responsibility to know what's due. I will send a message on Discord and
Brightspace whenever I make a change.

#### Homework for Wednesday
