### Class rules

This class is fast-paced, difficult, and time consuming. You will have to
learn many skills that are new to you, and you will spend many, many hours
working on your assignments.  You are all top students, otherwise you wouldn't
be at NYUAD. You have gotten here because of your excellent academic skills.
You are used to estimating how long an assignment or project will take based
on your past experiences.  Physical computing involves skills which are
probably new to most of you: mechanics and physical construction.  When the
assignments require skill with which you have little experience, your
estimates can be very, **very**, *very* wrong.  Don't take this class if you
aren't prepared to work hard and invest the necessary amount of time.

On the other hand, I am here for you. I want to see you succeed. I like seeing
your projects succeed. You will find me very accessible and helpful. I am
online at all hours and can often solve problem via Discord. I'm also very
available in person and spend much time outside of class in the IM lab. You
can approach me at any time, but *you* must take the initiative and reach out
to me, and you must not wait until the last minute. You must try hard to solve
your problems, and if you can't solve them, you must reach out to me while
there is still time for me to help you.

In return I have expectations of you: I expect you to come to class on time
and to be fully present. I expect you to be fully engaged in the course, and to
fully participate in and contribute to class discussion. I expect you to work
hard, very hard, to try to solve problems on your own, and to ask me for help
when you run into trouble. You must use Discord for all technical problems.

I do not tolerate the use of cellphones or laptops in class for anything other
than what we're actively working on.  If you need any exceptions, talk to me.
I strongly recommend that you take notes on paper.  In particular, when I help
you, I like being able to make notes on paper, so I require that each of you
will have a notebook on hand when you ask for my help.

I understand that there is more going on in your life than this class, indeed
more than university. If there is stuff going on your life that is making it
difficult to get your work done, contact me and we'll work something out.
Email is appropriate for these discussions.

One last thing: I don't want to get sick, not from COVID, and not from any
other illness. If you're feeling sick, please stay at home.

### Logistics

A reading will be assigned each week, and one of you will be responsible for
leading the discussion of that reading. Everyone must read the assigned
reading prior to class. The job of the discussion leader is to lead us into a
deep exploration of the reading. Do not summarize the reading! Come prepared
with questions or discussion points that require deep engagement. Simple yes
or no questions are not appropriate.

Each of you will make a presentation related broadly to the topic of this class

This course requires training on different tools. Training is offered only at
certain times, and the training staff does not have the resources to offer
training at other times. You must attend the training sessions unless there
is some truly exceptional reason. 

- Training in the wood shop will happen during class time.
- IM lab tool training will be provided in a limited number of sessions
	outside of class time. I urge you to attend these as soon as possible as
	they fill up, and you will need them almost immediately. If you took the IM
	lab tool training last fall you don't need to be trained again for the
	spring.
- You may require separate training for your particular project (e.g. sewing
	machines or welding). You will be responsible for reaching out to the
	relevant shop to arrange such training.

### Fabrication area
Our final project will be too big to fit in the IM lab, so we will have a
dedicated space, dedicated tools, and dedicated materials.
- Keep our tools and materials in our space
- *Always* clean up after yourselves, and always clean up a little more than
	whatever you left. Leave the space cleaner than you found it. Failure to do
	so will result in a lower grade.
- If you see anyone outside of our class using our tools, materials, or space,
	please get their names and inform me.
