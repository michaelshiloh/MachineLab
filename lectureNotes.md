### Syllabus

The syllabus is [here](syllabus.md)

#### Addendum to the syllabus

1. Cellphone and laptop use, except when part of a class activity, is
   prohibited
1. The first inappropriate use of cellphone or laptop will count as arriving
   late for that day; the second time will count as being absent for that day
1. You are required to take notes on paper. I will gather your notebooks
   periodically and they will be graded.  
1. I'm going to change the paper/presentation assignments. I'm not happy with
   how they have been going. I haven't yet figured out what the new method
   will be.

### About this class

This class is fast-paced, difficult, and time consuming. You will have to
learn many skills that are new to you, and you will spend many, many hours
working on your assignments.  

You are used to estimating how long an assignment or project will take based
on your past experiences.  Physical computing involves skills which are
probably new to most of you: mechanics, electronics, and physical
construction.  When the assignments require skill with which you have little
experience, your time estimates can be very, **very**, *very* wrong.  

I can almost guarantee that you will spend much more time on this class than
you think. Don't take this class if you aren't prepared to work hard and
invest the necessary amount of time.

On the other hand, I am here for you. I want to see you succeed. I like seeing
your projects succeed. You will find me very accessible and helpful. I am
online at all hours and can often solve problem via Discord. I'm also very
available in person and spend much time outside of class in the IM lab or in
my office. You can approach me at any time, but *you* must take the initiative
and reach out to me, and you must not wait until the last minute. You must try
seriously to solve your problems, and if you can't solve them, you must reach
out to me while there is still time for me to help you.

In return I have expectations of you: I expect you to come to class on time
and to be fully present. I expect you to be fully engaged in the course, and to
fully participate in and contribute to class discussion. I expect you to work
hard, very hard, to try to solve problems on your own, and to ask me for help
when you run into trouble. 

I am deeply committed to teaching. I expect you to be fully engaged in this
class. If you are not interested in this material and are taking this class
strictly to fulfill a requirement, I urge you to drop this class and allow
someone who is interested take your place.

I do not tolerate the use of cellphones, earphones, watches, or laptops in
class for anything other than what we're actively working on.  If you need any
exceptions, talk to me.  

I understand that there is more going on in your lives than this class.  If
there is stuff going on that is making it difficult to get your work done,
contact me and we'll work something out.  Email is appropriate for these
discussions.

### Logistics

This course requires training on different tools. Training is offered only at
certain times, and the training staff does not have the resources to offer
training at other times. You must attend the training sessions unless there
is some truly exceptional reason not to do so. 

You may require separate training for your particular project (e.g. sewing or
welding). You will be responsible for reaching out to the relevant shop to
arrange such training.

You are required to use Discord to ask all questions related to class,
whether technical, logistic, or otherwise. Reserve email for personal matters.

#### Cleaning up

We will be building things. We will use lots of tools and materials. It is
your responsibility to clean up after yourselves, to return tools and
materials to their places, and to put trash and recycling in the appropriate
bins.

Some of the tools and materials are for the exclusive use of our class; others
are generic tools and materials used by other classes. You must return things
to their proper place. If you don't know where something belongs, ask me or
one of the other professors or instructors or lab assistants. If none are
available put it on my shelf. Never put items in some random place to avoid
dealing with them.

In summary:

- *Always* clean up after yourselves, and always clean up a little more.
	Leave the space cleaner than you found it. Failure to do
	so will result in a lower grade.
- Return tools and unused materials to their proper places
- Discard trash and recycling in the proper bins
- Keep **our** tools and materials in **our** space
- If you see anyone outside of our class using our tools, materials, or space,
	please get their names and inform me.

#### How to make me unhappy

Use your cellphone or laptop in class. Sit in the back, don't ask
questions, and don't participate in discussions. Don't clean up after
yourself. Leave tip-out bins open, and spill out contents. Don't put
tools and parts back where they belong. Use jumper wires. Make poor
connections. Leave lots of exposed wire for short circuits. Come to class late
and return late from breaks.

#### How to make me happy 

Raise your hand in class. Interrupt me. Ask questions. Have a different
point of view. Make connections to other projects, artists, things you
have read, conversations you have had. Be critical. Cite your sources. Do
research. When debugging, don't try things at random: think logically
about what should be happening, what is happening, and why there is a
difference. Learn how to use test equipment and print statements to
understand what is going on. Practice soldering and don't be satisfied
with poor soldering. Ask questions. Reach out to me for help. Sit in the
front and pay attention. Leave your phone in your bag when you go to the
bathroom.

## Thursday January 29 2026 Week 2 
### Plan for today
- Announcements
- Homework
- Debugging
- Last year's project
- Theme

### Announcements
Thanks to the wonderful work of the ARC and for funding from the division, we
now have peer tutors for IM available in the IM lab. Please find the
IM Drop-in schedule
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j4KPN6QxLCA3Yo8UX07DAF0X8Im89mgtUR9B8ofNmW4/edit?gid=308586751#gid=308586751).

For now, students can just walk in, and tutors will record their details.
Students' sign-in will be more automated once the NYU Connect setup is
completed for IM tutoring.  

### Homework What did you learn about solving
problems?

#### Debugging
What are some techniques that you use?

Digital Multimeter (DMM) demonstration
- Measure voltage at servo motor and LED
- Measure voltage at 5V, Vin, and 3.3V
- Measure voltage of potentiometer at its input pin
- Measure voltage of one of the outputs controlling an LED
- How can we check if a pin is working as an output?

### Theme
Decision made! Theme: video games

### Motors

#### L298 Motor Driver with external power supply and large motor

To control a large motor, 
we need an intermediate device called a motor driver. Our
particular motor driver is based on the L298. To find out how we use it, we
simply Google "L298 Arduino".
[Here](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/arduino-dc-motor-control-tutorial-l298n-pwm-h-bridge/)
is the first thing that showed up for me. The point here is that many of the
components we use are quite generic and there is a lot of information on using
components with Arduino, but we can not follow the instructions blindly. We do
need to understand how it works.

**Warning** there is an error in the schematic under *Arduino and L298N Motor
Driver*. Can you spot the problem? Hint: Look at the schematic under *Arduino
Robot Car Control using L298N Motor Driver* and see if you can find the added
connection that was missing.

##### Code
Before you look at the code here, think about the circuit.
- `EN` needs to be `HIGH` in order to turn on the motor driver
- IN1 and IN2 need to be opposite (if one is `HIGH` then the other should be
  `LOW`) in order to make the motor turn
- Can you think of how to do this? (Hint: you can do this with 4 lines of code
  in `setup()` function and an empty `loop()` function)


Sample code, assuming you used these pins: 
```
void setup() {
  // Pins 2 and 3 are connected to In1 and In2 respectively
  // of the L298 motor driver
  pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(3, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // make the motor turn in one direction
  digitalWrite(2, LOW);
  digitalWrite(3, HIGH);
  delay(5000); // let it turn for 5 seconds

  // now reverse direction
  digitalWrite(2, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(3, LOW);
  delay(5000);
}
```
